I learned a few different super important things in this lesson. First, I am overcomplicating some of the concepts I'm learning to the point where it's crippling honestly. Second, Googling things or relying on other examples people have provided is okay. Third, just practice, man. Just do it. That's how you're going to nail this. 

I want to try and breakdown what types of things you'd typically see in CSS for format that I can think of. 
- background color
- color (meaning color of text)
- font size
- font weight
- font family
- text-align
- padding (space between contentn and the border). The format on this can be four different px numbers. The first is the top side and then it rotates clockwise. 
- border (outline between padding and margin)
- margin (space between this element and other elements). The format on this is the same as padding above. 
- gap (space between elements)

The element border-radius is used to round off corners of a flex element or image. For height and width, I have found it best to set only one of them to a px number and the other to auto to not distort the image. I'm sure there are better ways for me to accomplish this in the future. Remember to set display to flex when using flexbox. Remember which orientation you're using (column vs row) to help you format better. Use comments in both your HTML <!-- Comment --> and your CSS /* Comment */ to keep track of what formatting applies to which HTML. Again, I'm sure I will find better ways to do this in the future. 

The main thing I learned here is that if I focus and take my time, instead of over thinking everything and making it a <div> when I don't need to, I'll be in business. That, and being more flexible/less rigid will make me better at this.
